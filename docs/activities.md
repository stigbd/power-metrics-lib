## The  Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer (FIT) protocol
This library currently supports parsing fit-files. The FIT protocol is a file format used by Garmin devices to store activity data. The format is binary and is not human-readable. The format is documented in the [FIT SDK](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/).
